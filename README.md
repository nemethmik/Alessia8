# Alessia8
A multi-project repo for simple experimental web technology (Alessia Orro Number 8 in Europen Champion Italian Volleyball Team)

*basicnodetseslint* has its own readme.

## webcomps
Thhis is an experimental project to demonstrate how dead simple is to make web components with plain in-HTML JavaScript and how to improve the performance with lit-html.
This is not even a NodeJS project, it is just a pure HTML/JavaScript page just to demonstrate the fundamental concept of working with web components.
